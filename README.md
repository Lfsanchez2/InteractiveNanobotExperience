# Interactive NanoMed Experience
#### by Luis Sanchez

## Overview
Utilizes the p5 Clickable library to create an interactive experience focused on a series of fictional nanobots created by the NanoMed company.

You play as the CEO of the company and you pick choices based on the other 4 players of the game: Viktor, Malia, Gabriel, and Zeta.

This project utilizes a custom state manager that reads specifically formatted csv files to create a series of scenes described by events and choices. After a choice is picked in a secne, you are taken to a results page where you can see what effect your decision had on the players.

## Usage
Each scene will have buttons the user can press that will advance them through the storyline of the game.
