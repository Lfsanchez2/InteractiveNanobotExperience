Viktor's Research Proposal,"Viktor has some new ideas to take NanoMed into a new direction. He thinks it would be worthwhile to develop even more variations of the current nanobot medical drones. The process will take a while and will require consistent funding, but Viktor is committed to leading the research."
Missing Nanobots,"A batch of nanobots has gone missing. The finished nanobots are stored in secure locations throughout Hawaii, but someone has managed to acquire a small sample for unknown purposes. Not much can be done without further investigation into the matter."
Develop New Facilities,"As expansion operations have commenced, you can now try and set up new NanoMed facilities for development and storage outside of Hawaii. There is a proposal to set up 3 main branches out of Hawaii in San Francisco, CA, Chicago, IL, and another in Washington, D.C. "
